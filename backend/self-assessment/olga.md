# Self-Assessment  

- **Member name:** *Olga Chitembo*  
- **Contribution area:** *Backend mock data (data.js) for events, users, and transports. Route testing and API validation using Postman*

---

### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [Y] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [Y] Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?  
  - [N] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?  

- **Integration**
  - [Y] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?  
  - [Y] Are inputs and outputs managed appropriately?  

---

### 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [Y] Is your code easy to understand for other developers?  
  - [Y] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?  

- **Reusability**
  - [Y] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?  
  - [Y] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [Y] Are there comments explaining complex logic?  
  - [Y] Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?  

---

### 3. Performance
- **Efficiency**
  - [N] Are there any unnecessary operations or performance bottlenecks?  
  - [N] Is the code optimized for larger datasets or high traffic (if applicable)?  

---

### 4. Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**  
  - List the strengths of your contribution.  
    - Realistic dataset that supports UI testing and backend development.
    - Successfully tested route responses in Postman, ensuring correctness.
    - Easy-to-read data structure that other team members can work with.

- **Areas for Improvement**  
  - List areas where your code could be improved. 
    -  More documentation about each field could help other developers.

- **Action Plan**  
  - Outline specific steps to address the areas for improvement.  
    - Expand testing in Postman (e.g., negative tests, missing IDs, etc.)

---

### 5. Additional Notes
- Add any other relevant observations or feedback about your contribution.  
  - Testing the routes in Postman helped confirm that the backend structure is stable and ready for future integration with a database.
  - This work lays the foundation for proper API development in next sprint.
