# Self-Assessment  

- **Member name:** *Sailesh Karki*  
- **Contribution area:** *briefly describe what part of the project you worked on (e.g., frontend component, backend route, database schema, etc.)*

--- Currently I am working on backend building user authentication feature and simulataneously working with Admin Panel and user Panel building prototypes in figma. Beside that self researching on Hooks like UseState and UseEffect to development a profile component.

### 1. Functionality
- **Does the code meet the requirements?**
  - [ Coding has not started yet as I am still consulting with PO to finalize the page layout. ] Does it implement all specified features you were responsible for?  
  - [ Eddge cases and error handling will be considered in the initial development phase, especially for form validation and dynamic data in the profile development.] Are edge cases handled (e.g., invalid data, duplicates)?  
  - [ Currently there are no bugs or unexpected behaviours as code implementation is pending.] Are there any bugs or unexpected behaviors?  

- **Integration**
  - [ Currently no live code exists yet to integrate with other parts of the application, but my planned component designs follow conventionss established across the team.] Does your code work correctly with other parts of the application?  
  - [ Inputs/outputs for user data will be mapped and validated during development, aligned with backend API expectations.] Are inputs and outputs managed appropriately?  

---

### 2. Code Quality
- **Readability**
  - [ For both prototypes and planned code, Iaim for clear variable and function naming, with a strong focus on descriptive UI labels and interactions.] Is your code easy to understand for other developers?  
  - [ React Hooks (useState and useEffect) usage a will be documented for other developers.] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?  

- **Reusability**
  - [ For both prototypes and planned code, I aim to clear variable and function naming, with a strong focus on descriptive UI labels and interactions.] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?  
  - [ Logic will be separated into helper functions/hooks where possible.] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [ For all future code, I plan to comment on complex state logic and data fetching from the backend user profile routes.] Are there comments explaining complex logic?  
  - [ Figma prototypes are annotated; final code will include readme notes on structure and usage.] Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?  

---

### 3. Performance
- **Efficiency**
  - [ Performance optimization will start after initial implementation, with focus on reducing innecessary re-renders and carefully managing state in the user panel.] Are there any unnecessary operations or performance bottlenecks?  
  - [I will benchmark profile component responsiveness with real data, develop strategies for scalable rendering if the user/ event dataset grows. ] Is the code optimized for larger datasets or high traffic (if applicable)?  

---

### 4. Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**  
  - List the strengths of your contribution.  
    - Strong planning and coordination with PO on UI structure.
    - Commitment to research on React best practices and hook usage .
    - Figma prototypes provide a clear reference for team development and future integration.

- **Areas for Improvement**  
  - List areas where your code could be improved.  
    - Implementation needs to start soon to maintain sprint momentum.
    - More proactive definition of edge case handling and data flow between frontend and backend.
    - Researching the React documentation page to understand the implementation of different libraries will help improve component logic.

- **Action Plan**  
  - Outline specific steps to address the areas for improvement.  

--- Begin code implementation for Admin and User Panel and user profile component immediately after final PO approval.
  - Regularly sync with backend team to align on data contracts.
  - Continue researching efficient state management and scalable UI patterns.
  - Document logic and code decision for easy onboarding.

### 5. Additional Notes
- Add any other relevant observations or feedback about your contribution.  
  - The presentation and feedback session today goes well that confirms our UI direction meets stakeholders expectations.
  - Team discussions this sprint highlighted the importance of integrating modular design and proactive planning before coding, which I will apply moving forward.
  - I am ready to collaborate with the new sprint master and team on cross-functional features for upcoming sprint.
