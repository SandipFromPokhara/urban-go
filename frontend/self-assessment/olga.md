  - [Y] Are variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?  

- **Reusability**
  - [Y] Can your code or parts of it be reused elsewhere in the application?
  - [Y] Is logic modular and separated from unrelated concerns?  

- **Comments and Documentation**
  - [N] Are there comments explaining complex logic?  The code is mostly self-explanatory
  - [N] Is there documentation for how to use your code unit?  Documentation exists through clear prop usage and component structure

### 4. Overall Assessment
- **Strengths**  
  - List the strengths of your contribution.  
    - Implemented a fully functional, interactive SeeAlsoSection carousel with scroll buttons and hover animations.
    - Clean, modular code with clear prop usage and responsive layout.
    - Smooth Framer Motion animations enhance UX.
    - Dark mode integration handled properly with conditional styles.

- **Areas for Improvement**  
  - List areas where your code could be improved.  
    - Category grid has no filtering functionality and clicking a category currently just navigates to the event page; adding dynamic filtering would improve usability.

- **Action Plan**  
  - Outline specific steps to address the areas for improvement.  
    - Add dynamic filtering so users can select categories and see relevant events
